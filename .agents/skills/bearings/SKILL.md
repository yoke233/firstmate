# bearings

Generate a complete standalone snapshot from the fleet's current state, so the captain can resume in one read after a break, a night, or a context reset.
The deliverable is a dated markdown file plus a concise chat summary that each stand on the current snapshot rather than an earlier report.
This skill is read-mostly.
It reads fleet state and writes exactly one report file.
It never tears down a task, merges a PR, dispatches new work, or mutates any task state as a side effect of producing the brief - those belong to the captain's explicit word and the normal task lifecycle.

## What it does

1. **Gather live fleet state with one deterministic command.**
   Run `bin/fm-bearings-snapshot.sh` and read its compact output.
   It is the single bounded, deterministic source for this report and renders TOON by default.
   Do not hand-probe the snapshot schema and do not make ad-hoc `gh-axi`/`gh` calls to assemble fleet facts; this command already assembles them.
   The command's header and `--help` output own its exact fields, bounds, opt-ins, and output contract.
   When the captain asks to include PRs, use the command's live-PR opt-in; otherwise keep the default local-only read.
   If the command is unavailable, fall back to `bin/fm-fleet-snapshot.sh --json` and `bin/fm-crew-state.sh <id>`; never infer current state from a raw `tail` of `state/<id>.status`, which is append-only wake-event history whose last line goes stale.
   For registered secondmates, use the snapshot's structured-home classification and provenance; a parent event or bounded terminal contradiction is fallback evidence, never authority over readable structured home state.
   Structured captain-held decisions come from `decision-hold-lifecycle` and appear under `decisions_open`; do not scrape reports or visual-review artifacts to supplement them.
   A queued item under `gates` only becomes "next work" when its blocker is gone and its time/date gate has arrived; until then it stays queued with the reason.
   The `(main-inventory)` gate is an action-free integrity warning rather than queued work: render it under Charted Next with the related `omitted` disclosure, never invent an Underway row from backlog-only state, and never move it into Captain's Call.

2. **Compose the detailed report file around the four-section spine, adding the richer detail the chat leaves out.**
   The gather step is deterministic; your judgment is scoped to the last mile only - ranking the command's facts by what matters right now and writing the scannable prose.
   Never read an earlier `data/status-report-*.md` to decide what to omit, include, describe as changed, or call current.
   The report uses the same four complete sections as the chat (see the chat-response contract below), in the same order, each always present, and adds the detail the chat omits:
   - **Title** - `# Bearings - <day> <YYYY-MM-DD>` (use "Morning status" only when the captain specifically asks for a morning brief), followed by two or three sentences framing where things stand.
   - **Captain's Call** - every open decision summarized with its options from the structured decision record, plus each PR ready to merge and each needed credential or login, every PR with the full `https://...` URL, never a bare `#number`.
   - **Recently Landed** - the bounded current recent-completions baseline from structured state across the main fleet and every registered secondmate home, rendered in full on every run.
   - **Underway** - each live direct report making progress, with its current state, and the plans / main pickup pointers worth reopening (`data/<id>/report.md` files, `.lavish/*.html` boards).
   - **Charted Next** - queued or gated work, including any main-inventory integrity warning, with each item's blocker, date, or integrity reason.

3. **Write the dated report file so it persists, then surface the mandatory four-section digest in chat.**
   - Write the full report to `data/status-report-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` using today's date.
     This is the required artifact; it lives in gitignored `data/`.
     If today's file already exists, delete it first, then create a new file from scratch.
   - The chat response is the concise four-section digest defined by the contract below: materially shorter than the report file, complete as a current snapshot, internally consistent with the file, and linked to that file for the full picture.
   - For a richer review surface, optionally offer a Lavish board with `lavish-axi` when the report has enough structure to deserve one, but the markdown file is the required artifact and the four-section chat digest is the required minimum.

## Chat-response contract

This skill is the one owner of the `/bearings` chat-response format; the snapshot and classifier own the data that feeds it, and no other file restates this contract.
Every `/bearings` chat response renders EXACTLY these four sections, in THIS order, and nothing else structural (there is no At Anchor section):

1. **Captain's Call** - ONLY items that need the captain's own action now: a decision to make, a PR to approve or merge, a credential or login to provide, or a blocker only the captain can clear.
   Empty-state: "Nothing needs your action right now."
2. **Recently Landed** - the bounded current recent-completions baseline: merged PRs, completed scouts, and finished local-only merges across the main fleet and every registered secondmate home.
   Empty-state: "No recent completions are in the current baseline."
3. **Underway** - live work progressing on its own, one line of current state per direct report.
   Empty-state: "Nothing is underway."
4. **Charted Next** - queued or gated work waiting on the fleet or a date, plus action-free fleet-integrity warnings, never on the captain.
   Empty-state: "Nothing is queued."

Rules that keep the contract unambiguous:

- Every section ALWAYS renders, even when empty, with its short empty-state sentence; never omit a section.
- Every report and chat digest is a complete current snapshot, never a delta against a prior report.
- Recently Landed always renders the bounded current baseline, even when the same completions appeared in an earlier report.
- The four buckets are mutually exclusive, so every item is forced into exactly one: needs-your-action is Captain's Call, done is Recently Landed, self-progressing is Underway, and not-yet-started work or an action-free fleet-integrity warning is Charted Next.
- The strict boundary keeps action-free items OUT of Captain's Call: a working or validating task, a queued item blocked on another task or a date, landed work, a completed scout's report pointer, a declared `paused:` external wait, and a bare recorded PR with no merge-ready signal each belong to one of the other three sections, never Captain's Call.
- A secondmate's own row appears Underway only for `active_child_work`; `externally_held` belongs in Charted Next, and `unknown` belongs there as an unavailable-state gate unless its reason requires the captain's action.
- Do not suppress separately projected decisions, landed records, or gates from a `partial-structured` home merely because that secondmate's own row is `unknown`.
- The chat follows `AGENTS.md` section 9 and carries one scannable line per item, each PR as the full `https://...` URL; detailed decisions, plans, full gate reasons, and evidence live only in the report file, which the chat links to, so the chat stays materially shorter than that file.

## Tone and content rules

- This report is a private, captain-facing internal artifact that lives in gitignored `data/`, so unlike normal captain chat it MAY reference task ids, PR URLs, and repo names - the captain works with these directly and needs them to resume; keep it organized and scannable, not a raw dump.
- Every PR reference is a full `https://...` URL, never a bare `#number`; a shorthand `#number` is fine only as a back-reference after the full URL has already appeared in the same report.
- Never include PHI or secret values; the report is an operational artifact, but it is still subject to the same security and compliance rules that govern everything else in this fleet.

## Supervision discipline

This skill is read-mostly and changes no fleet state.
Do not tear down a task, merge a PR, dispatch queued work, or mutate any `state/` or `data/` file other than the single report file as a side effect of generating the brief.
If the state you read suggests an action - a PR ready to merge, a queued item whose gate has arrived, a needs-decision finding - name it in its section (a captain action under "Captain's Call", queued or gated work under "Charted Next") and let the captain decide, rather than taking the action from inside this skill.
