# fm-marker-lib.sh - the from-firstmate request marker.
#
# When the MAIN firstmate relays a work request to one of its SECONDMATES,
# bin/fm-send.sh prepends this marker to the message text. A secondmate is itself
# a firstmate running in its own home, so without a marker it treats every
# incoming fm-send/tmux line as if its captain typed it and answers
# CONVERSATIONALLY in its own chat. But the main firstmate never reads a
# secondmate's chat: the only main<-secondmate wakeup channel is the status file
# (charter escalation), optionally pointing to a doc for detail. A detailed
# chat-only reply therefore strands, unseen.
#
# The marker lets the secondmate tell its supervisor's request apart from a
# message the captain typed directly into its pane:
#
#   - marked   -> a from-firstmate request. Do the work, then respond via the
#                 STATUS/ESCALATION path (a status line for a terse result, or a
#                 doc plus a status pointer - the scout-report pattern - for a
#                 detailed one) so it surfaces to the main firstmate via the
#                 watcher signal. It MUST NOT respond only in chat.
#   - unmarked -> the captain typing directly. Stay conversational, exactly as
#                 before: authoritative captain intervention.
#
# This contract lives in the generated secondmate charter (bin/fm-brief.sh) so it
# travels with the live secondmate, and is summarized in AGENTS.md.
#
# Distinct from the afk daemon marker, on purpose.
# Both terminal-safe markers use U+2063 INVISIBLE SEPARATOR because it has no
# normal keyboard keystroke but travels as UTF-8 text rather than a terminal
# control byte. The away-mode marker is a BARE leading U+2063; this marker begins
# with its human-readable label and places U+2063 after it, so the two cannot
# conflate. The original ASCII 0x1f separator did not survive terminal input
# faithfully: on Herdr 0.7.3 feeding it to a real Pi composer removed marker
# content, so Pi received an unmarked message. docs/herdr-backend.md records both
# incidents and their live proof.
#
# Sourced by bin/fm-send.sh, bin/fm-brief.sh, and the tests. No side effects on
# source. set -u / set -e safe.

# The label field: human-readable, greppable, and distinctive enough that the
# captain would not type it by hand. This is the part the secondmate's LLM reads.
