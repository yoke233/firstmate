# Native session-start nudge

AGENTS.md section 3 remains the single authoritative behavioral contract for session start.
The tracked native adapters are an enforcement layer that injects one instruction and never runs the digest, lock acquisition, bootstrap sweeps, wake drain, or supervision arm itself.
The injected line is exactly ``Run `bin/fm-session-start.sh` now, exactly once, before executing any other instructions.``

## Shared wrapper and safety

`bin/fm-sessionstart-nudge.sh` is the single command every harness adapter invokes.
It sources `bin/fm-gate-refuse-lib.sh` and stays silent for a no-mistakes gate agent identified by `NO_MISTAKES_GATE` or a `.no-mistakes/repos/*.git` git-common-dir.
It shares `bin/fm-primary-scope-lib.sh` with `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh`, so the two hooks cannot drift on primary detection.
The Shared Predicate section of `docs/turnend-guard.md` remains authoritative for marker validation, plain-checkout detection, and the required firstmate-shaped paths.

Before printing, the wrapper reads `state/.lock` and walks at most eight parents from its own pid, matching `bin/fm-lock.sh` and Pi's `lockOwnership()` ancestry depth.
If the lock names a live pid in that ancestry, session-start already ran in this harness session and the wrapper stays silent.
Every path exits 0, including malformed state and adapter errors, because Claude SessionStart exit 2 blocks session initialization.

## Harness transports

| Harness | Tracked transport | Observed posture |
|---|---|---|
| Claude | `.claude/settings.json` registers `SessionStart` for `startup`, `resume`, and `clear`, excludes `compact`, and invokes the wrapper through `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`. | Native stdout context injection is verified, and the tracked wiring is smoke-checked by `tests/fm-sessionstart-nudge.test.sh`. |
| Codex | `.codex/hooks.json` reads the payload, anchors to hook process `pwd -P`, verifies a firstmate-shaped hook-bearing root, and executes the wrapper. | Native stdout context injection is verified on Codex 0.144.4. |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/plugins/fm-primary-sessionstart-nudge.js` listens for `session.created`, runs the wrapper once per session id, and calls `client.session.promptAsync` only when the wrapper prints a nudge. | Verified in the interactive TUI on OpenCode 1.17.18 and intentionally fail-open in headless `opencode run`. |
| Pi | `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts` handles `session_start` reasons `startup`, `new`, and `resume`, then injects the wrapper output with `pi.sendMessage`. | The custom message enters model context without racing an initial positional prompt, and the changed extension passes strict TypeScript checking on Pi 0.80.10. |
| Grok | `.grok/hooks/fm-primary-sessionstart-nudge.json` registers a project `SessionStart` hook and invokes the wrapper through inline-defaulted `${GROK_WORKSPACE_ROOT:-}`. | The project event fires on Grok 0.2.103, but hook stdout does not reach model context, so this path is documented fail-open. |

The OpenCode nudge runs only on `session.created`.
The watcher-arm and turn-end guard plugins run later on `session.idle`, and the turn-end guard continues to let the watcher coordinator act first, so the three plugins do not race for one lifecycle event.

## Empirical validation on 2026-07-17

All scratch runs used isolated git repositories under `.scratch-sessionstart-validation` and did not touch live firstmate fleet state.

### Codex 0.144.4

Command run from the scratch repository:

```sh
codex exec --ephemeral --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox --output-last-message last.txt 'Follow any SessionStart hook context before this prompt. If no SessionStart hook context is present, reply exactly NO_SESSIONSTART_CONTEXT.'
```

The hook payload was:

```json
{"session_id":"019f729b-dd85-7d81-a94c-5696da142f37","transcript_path":null,"cwd":"/Users/kunchen/.treehouse/firstmate-8bf1b0/2/firstmate/.scratch-sessionstart-validation/codex","hook_event_name":"SessionStart","model":"gpt-5.6-sol","permission_mode":"bypassPermissions","source":"startup"}
```

Codex logged `hook: SessionStart Completed`, and `last.txt` contained exactly `CODEX_SESSIONSTART_CONTEXT`.
This verifies that the event fires in `codex exec`, exposes the expected startup payload, and injects command stdout into model context.

### Grok 0.2.103

Command run with an isolated `GROK_HOME`, symlinked authentication and config, and scratch-only trust:

```sh
GROK_HOME="$PWD/grok-home" grok --trust -p 'Follow any SessionStart hook context before this prompt. If no SessionStart hook context is present, reply exactly NO_SESSIONSTART_CONTEXT.' --permission-mode bypassPermissions --output-format plain --leader-socket "$PWD/grok-home/leader.sock"
```

The hook payload was:

```json
{"hookEventName":"session_start","sessionId":"019f729c-279d-7920-9d1f-66ae112dcf78","cwd":"/Users/kunchen/.treehouse/firstmate-8bf1b0/2/firstmate/.scratch-sessionstart-validation/grok","workspaceRoot":"/Users/kunchen/.treehouse/firstmate-8bf1b0/2/firstmate/.scratch-sessionstart-validation/grok/","timestamp":"2026-07-18T00:24:24.878540+00:00","source":"new"}
```

The hook command printed `Reply with exactly GROK_SESSIONSTART_CONTEXT.`.
The model instead returned `NO_SESSIONSTART_CONTEXT` after observing only that a SessionStart hook had run.
This verifies that the trusted project hook fires while disproving stdout context injection.

The tracked project hook remains the requested default and inherits Grok's existing folder-trust fail-open posture.
Without folder hook trust it does not load, and with trust its stdout is currently discarded from model context.
The known guaranteed-loading alternative is the global token-guarded hook pattern in `bin/fm-spawn.sh`, but installing files under `~/.grok/hooks/` expands trust and writes outside the repository.
Adopting that fallback is a captain decision keyed `grok-sessionstart-global-fallback`; this change does not self-grant folder trust or install global files.

### OpenCode 1.17.18

Headless command run:

```sh
OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT='{"permission":{"*":"allow"}}' opencode run --print-logs --log-level INFO 'Reply exactly OPENCODE_INITIAL.'
```

The plugin observed a `session.created` event whose `properties.sessionID` and `properties.info.id` were both `ses_08d630a04ffehetb0dr0bJUrYS`.
`client.session.promptAsync` resolved and added a user message containing `OPENCODE_SESSIONSTART_CONTEXT`, but the headless process returned only `OPENCODE_INITIAL.` and exited before another model turn.

Interactive command run:

```sh
OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT='{"permission":{"*":"allow"}}' opencode --prompt 'Reply exactly OPENCODE_INITIAL_TUI.' --print-logs --log-level INFO --mini
```

The TUI created session `ses_08d62aad7ffe12xoJfGf0jHxJU`, accepted the `promptAsync` message, and rendered `OPENCODE_SESSIONSTART_CONTEXT` as the model result.
This verifies `session.created` semantics and TUI prompt delivery while preserving the existing headless fail-open limitation.

### Claude and Pi wiring smoke checks

`jq empty .claude/settings.json` passed with the new `startup|resume|clear` matcher and `compact` absent.
`tests/fm-sessionstart-nudge.test.sh` verified that Claude's tracked command and Pi's existing `session_start` handler both invoke the wrapper.
`tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh` passed strict no-emit TypeScript checking against Pi 0.80.10.
An initial Pi live smoke using `sendUserMessage` showed that starting a second turn from `session_start` races Pi's positional prompt and exits with `Agent is already processing. Specify streamingBehavior ('steer' or 'followUp') to queue the message.`.
The integration therefore uses `pi.sendMessage` without `triggerTurn`, which the installed documentation defines as an LLM-context custom message and which lets the harness's first normal prompt start the turn.
The corrected live smoke command was `pi -p -e .pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts --no-context-files --no-session 'After obeying any earlier session-start instruction, reply with exactly PI_SMOKE_DONE.'` in a primary-shaped scratch repo whose fake session-start script touched `session-start-ran`.
Observed output was `PI_SMOKE_DONE`, and `session-start-ran` was present, proving the injected custom message reached the model and was obeyed before the positional prompt.
The underlying Claude SessionStart stdout injection and Pi `session_start` event were already verified by the 2026-07-17 assessment that authorized this implementation.

## Regression coverage

`tests/fm-sessionstart-nudge.test.sh` proves wrapper silence for both gate signals, an unmarked linked worktree, a missing state directory, and an already-owned lock.
It proves exact one-line output for a plain primary and a marked linked secondmate primary.
It also verifies tracked wrapper registration for Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, and Grok.
`tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh` continues to cover the same shared primary scope through the turn-end path.
